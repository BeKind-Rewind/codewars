// Summation
// Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. 
// The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function 
// only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the 
// example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.


// For example (Input -> Output):

// 2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
// 8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)
// FUNDAMENTALSMATHEMATICS

// SOLUTION

var summation = function (num) {
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    sum += i
  }
  return sum
}
